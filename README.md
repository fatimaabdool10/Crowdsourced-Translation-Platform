## Usage Guide

### Project Creation

```javascript
// Example project creation
const projectManager = await ProjectManager.deployed();
await projectManager.createProject(
    contentHash,
    sourceLanguage,
    targetLanguage,
    deadline,
    budget,
    { from: contentOwner }
);
```

### Reputation Calculation

```solidity
reputationScore = (qualityScore * 0.4) + (speedScore * 0.3) + 
                  (reliabilityScore * 0.2) + (communityRating * 0.1)
where:
- qualityScore: Average quality of translations (0-100)
- speedScore: Delivery speed relative to deadlines
- reliabilityScore: Project completion rate
- communityRating: Peer review scores
```
